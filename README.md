Establish a Culture of Equity and Inclusion




Andrew  rolls  down  the  hallway  of  his  middle  school  with  two  other  students  walking  alongside  him.  Suddenly  Andrew’s  wheelchair  stops,  and he looks at his lap tray. Sean and Jesse notice and back up to flank Andrew again. He is pointing to a word on his tray.


“Wait, what did you say?” asks Sean.  
Andrew looks at his lap tray again and touches the word you. 
Jesse repeats it aloud: “You.” 
Then Andrew moves to the letter area, touching f,o,r and g. 
“Forgot?” Jesse offers. 
Andrew  nods,  smiling,  and  then  looks  back  to  his  tray,  touching you and r. 
Jesse says, “Your.” Andrew starts spelling again: b,o,o,k. Jesse  gets  it.  
“Oh  man,  you’re  right!  I  gotta  have  the  book  for  English. Thanks for reminding me. I’ll catch up. Maybe you guys can distract Ms. VanArk so she doesn’t notice I’m late!”


Andrew and Sean head off to class while Jesse runs back to his locker. When  they  get  to  Ms. Van Ark’s  classroom,  Sean  opens  the  door  and Andrew rolls in. Sean moves a chair that is blocking Andrew’s path, probably mistakenly left there by the last group of students. It’s all very ordinary, and no one seems to notice the give-and-take between the boys. 


In  another  part  of  the  building,  a  group  of  teachers  is  meeting  during planning  time  and  working  through  a  series  of  learning  progressions  for a unit of study on the American Revolution. They are discussing the flow of the daily lessons and which materials they want to use to build student mastery  of  the  content.  Teacher  Brad  Henderson  says,  “In  our  last  unit, I’m  not  sure  we  had  students  reading  enough  from  primary  sources.  I’d like to see our students do more of that. There are so many great sources from  this  time  period.  We  could  select  some  and  then  have  them  ready in  large  print,  audio,  and  adapted  versions.  I  would  like  to  use  them  in small  groups  this  time  so  that  I  can  see  how  students  are  responding  to the texts.”


There  is  general  agreement.  Then  teacher  Amal  Ali  says,  “Before  we go any further, can we revisit the assessments we’ll use? I’ve been thinking about it, and we need to give students more choices for how they can demonstrate  mastery.  And  I  think  they  all  should  have  practice  with  a formal assessment and options for how to demonstrate understanding in creative ways. Thoughts?”


The  team  continues  discussing  their  plans  and  building  an  inclusive set of experiences for students. They do not talk about “what to do about SPED students” or how to adjust developed lessons to accommodate specific learning needs—the sort of conversation that is prevalent in many schools.  It’s  not  even  clear  which  of  the  teachers  are  “special  educators” and  which  are  “general  educators.”  What is clear  is  that  all  of  the  teachers present  value  the  learning  of  all  students  in  much  the  same  way  that Andrew, Sean, and Jesse value each other—casually, as an ordinary matter of course. This way of regarding all students as “our students” is far from common. But that could change, and it needs to.







Beliefs Drive Inclusive Education and Equity

We  start  with  the  culture  of  inclusion  because  it’s  foundational  to  the creation of schools that work for all students. The philosophy of the staff within  a  school  directly  and  significantly  affects  the  systems  of  support that are available for students. We have learned the hard way that meaningful  improvements  in  what  a  school does only stick and have purpose when  the  adults  in  the  school  reevaluate  what  they  know  and  come  to  a new  understanding  of  the  labels  and  language  they  use,  how  instruction and intervention should be delivered, where students are served, the roles of everyone in the school, and what their expectations are — for both their students and themselves. Shanice’s  family  moved  to  a  new  city  the  summer  before  she  started high school. The first 10 years of her school experience were spent in self contained  special  education  classrooms  with  no  participation  at  all  in the general education classroom. During elementary school, she and the other students with disabilities even ate lunch at a different time than the rest of the student body. 


They were different, a group apart.


At Shanice’s new school, all of her classes were general education courses:  Earth  Science,  English 9, Algebra I, Art, and Biology. When Shanice’s mother called at the end of the second week and asked to meet with the principal and special education teacher, they worried that some- thing was wrong. In fact, when they sat down to meet with Shanice’s mom, the first question they asked her was, “Is everything OK?”
Shanice’s mom started to cry. It took her several minutes to compose herself, and when she did, this is what she said: It’s  like  you  gave  me  a  different  kid.  She  has  grown  so much  in academics and social skills. I can’t believe that I agreed to keeping  her  out  of  regular  classes  all  those  years.  I’m  glad  I  trusted you  this  summer  when  we  met  and  you  said  that  your  philosophy  was  that  students  belonged  together  and  that  you  could organise supports. I let you try, but really, I was expecting you to call and tell me that it wasn’t working. But you didn’t, because it is. Thank you for all that you’re doing for my daughter. Did Shanice’s needs suddenly change over the summer? Or did Shan- ice  change  in  response  to  her  new  experiences  in  a  school  committed  to the belief that all students had the capacity to meet high expectations and committed  to  maintaining  systems  of  support  to  align  with  that  belief ?


We, and the actual parties involved, know it was the latter. Shanice became different because the new school she went to was different. It was more sophisticated, and the members of the staff valued the membership of all students and had figured out how to support students’ various needs. We have  never  encountered  an  inclusive  school  in  which  the  faculty  did  not believe in what they were doing. As you will see over and over again in this book, it’s the philosophy that drives an effective system. With the rapid growth in programs to support students who are struggling,  it  can  be  tempting  to  latch  onto  one  of  those  as  a  starting  point. School leaders may, for example, attempt to nudge the needle of inclusion by  launching  a  full-tilt  multi-tiered  system  of  supports  (MTSS)  effort, implementing  a  reading  intervention  program,  or  digging  into  a  complete  overhaul  of  their  individualised  education  program  (IEP)  process. While  these  are  essential  components  of  successfully  inclusive  schools, starting with procedures rather than with the vision dooms a school to a series of never-ending “tweaks”and a seemingly infinite number of “initiatives.”  


Achieving  the  outcome  students  deserve  requires  a  complete reimagining.  Equity  and  inclusion  must  become  the  ethos  of  the  school. Excellent education for all should be the objective and the impetus—what drives every initiative, program, or strategy. Shifting  the  culture  of  a  school  to  embrace  inclusion  is  much  more complicated  than  simply  sharing  the  research  that  says  inclusion  works (e.g., Fisher,  Roach,  &  Frey,  2002).  It  involves  dismantling  the  status quo,   disrupting   long-held   beliefs   about   learners   and   about   teaching.


Fundamental  to  this  work  is  replacing  a  climate  of sorting  and  ranking students  with  one  of mastery - believing  and  expecting  that  all  students can achieve at high levels. Having  a  culture  of  mastery  means  every  single  person  in  the  school embraces  every  student,  without  exception,  as  worthy  and  deserving  of their  best.  It  means  never  turning  our  back  on  a  student  because  “she’s yours, not mine.” It means never giving up on any student, because there’s an  expectation  that every student can achieve at a higher level than ever before.  In  a  culture  of  mastery,  everyone  on  staff believes that in order to  meet  the  needs  of all students,  it’s  necessary  to  meet  the  needs  of each student.




Language and Labels Matter

If  excellent  educational  outcomes  for  all  is  the  goal  (it  is),  the  sobering truth is that there is a long way to go. Regardless of whether the measure is achievement scores, graduation rates, post-school employment, or college acceptance rates, the conclusion is the same: students with disabilities are not faring well in the current education system. These poor outcomes are fueled in part by the damage done when disability labelling lowers expectations. Students identified as having disabilities  encounter  bias  from  their  teachers,  especially  in  the  form  of  lower expectations,  more  negative  evaluation  of  behaviour,  and  negative  predictions  about  whether  they  are  likely  to  earn  an  undergraduate  degree(Shifrer,  2013).  And  this  culture  affects  all  marginalised  students,  not only those with disabilities. Because of the evolution of essentially separate  systems,  special  education  has  long  been  used  as  a  way  to  label  and segregate  instead  of  support.  The  dichotomous  sorting  of  our  education system has led to inappropriately labelling a disproportionate number of African American students, particularly boys, as having behavioural disorders (Cooc & Kiru, 2018). The majority of U.S. school systems are staffed by  adults  who  are  largely  white,  female,  and  middle  class,  and  they  can struggle  to  understand  behaviour expression  unlike  their  own  (Delpit,2006).  Most  often,  the  problem  isn’t  even  students’  behaviour  per  se;  it’s the  mismatch  in  cultural  expectations  and  a  misunderstanding  of  high- and low-context behaviours. 


When Hattie (2012) used meta-analyses from 50,000 studies to calculate  the  magnitude  of  250  different  influences on student achievement, he determined that the overall effect size (the magnitude of an influence) equivalent to a year’s worth of academic growth in school is .40. The practice of not labelling students (e.g., as “struggling,” “gifted,” “high achieving,” “special ed”) has an effect size of .61, meaning that it accelerates learning. Although it is necessary to identify whether a student qualifies for an IEP in order to receive special education services and safeguards, in the daily classroom, labelling  has  a  negative effect. The  label  often  becomes  “the reason” why the student is not progressing. Students develop low expectations for themselves, because that’s what everyone else does, and the self fulfilling prophecy is realised when students meet these low expectations.Kirby  (2017) notes  that  the  combination  of  poor  self- concept  and  negative views of teachers has a lasting effect on students, which is counter to the mission of educators. As he puts it, “The education system should be decreasing the impact of disability on a student’s academic performance, not exacerbating it” (p. 183). In short, labelling can too easily marginalise and hurt rather than help.


The  practice  of  “tracking ”  students,  common  in  the  1970s  and  1980s, illustrates   exactly   the   harm   that   results   from   leaving   student   needs unmet. As early as kindergarten, students were sorted into ability groups based   on   their   academic   performance   and   perceived   potential   (low, medium, and high). The idea was to provide greater academic challenges for students who were ready to move forward and greater support to those who struggled. In actuality, though, students in the lower groups received slower-paced  instruction  as  a replacement for  core  instruction—which effectively trapped them within their track throughout their elementary and  secondary  years.  They  sank  further  and  further  behind,  and  by  high school,  many  of  these  students  were  grade  levels  behind  in  crucial  literacy, problem-solving, and mathematics skills. This service delivery model failed students who could have been college- and career-bound by not providing  them  with  simple  interventions  in  early  childhood.  For  students with disabilities, the situation was even worse: they were tracked into segregated special education classrooms with an even weaker curriculum.


Unfortunately,   tracking   lives   on.   There   are   still   permanent   ability groups  of  low-,  middle-,  and  high-achieving  students  in  some  elementary  classrooms.  Students  remain homogeneously  grouped  with  similarly achieving  students  throughout  the  day.  The  low-achieving  groups  are especially vulnerable, as they lack the language, social, and academic models that are present in heterogeneous groups. Although needs-based small- group instruction is an effective practice, permanent ability grouping and tracking  have  a  detrimental  effect on students’ self-efficacy and on their level of school engagement (Dumont, Protsch, Jansen, & Becker, 2017).


Changing the culture of a school to be receptive to real inclusion starts with changing the language educators use. 


First, labels belong in the conversation only when discussing services and rights; they have no place in a conversation about the systems of support for a student. 


Second, in times when  it’s  necessary  to  speak  of  disability  categories  or  supports,  all  faculty  should  feel  the  importance  of,  and  embrace  the  use  of,  people-first language.  Rather  than  “autistic  child,”  say  “a  child  with  autism”  (when talking  about  services  and  supports) — or  just  call  the  kid  by  his  name: Timothy. 


Rather than say Angela is “wheelchair-bound,” you might mention that Angela “rolls to class.” 


Changes in language serve as the foundation for the widespread change in mindset that must occur if schools are ever  to  deliver  on  the  promise  of  equity  for  all  students,  including  those with disabilities. 


Not  only  is  there  a  history  of  the  overuse  of  disability  labels,  but  too many  schools  have  also  acquired  the  habit  of  labelling  students  based  on the supports they need: “Let’s have a meeting about our Tier 2s and 3s this afternoon.” There are no “special education students” or “Tier 2” or “Tier 3  students,”  and  students  are  never  exclusively  “yours”  or  “mine.”  Every student  in  the  building  is our  student first and  foremost.  


Special  education and Tier 2 and 3 interventions are supports that are provided. They are nouns, not adjectives, and they should never be used to describe a student’s permanent or long-term status. They are not any student’s identity. What’s more, all students in the building are on the specialist’s or special  educator’s  caseload.  Any  child  who  can  benefit from a specialised strategy,  accommodation,  or  modification  is  their  responsibility.  And  do you  know  of  any  student  who  has  never  needed  support  with anything academically, socially, or otherwise during their formative years? To deny expert assistance to a student in need because there is no IEP in place is to deny that student an equitable education.




Everyone Deserves to Belong

The   1970s   also   introduced   the   practice   of mainstreaming —an   early attempt  to  create  less  restrictive  placements  for  students  with  mild  dis- abilities.  In  this  model,  students  who  demonstrated  competence  could receive  their  education  in  the  general  education  classroom.  But  this approach  placed  the  burden  on  students:  they  had  to  somehow  catch  up to grade level while receiving a lower-level replacement curriculum, and then  they  had  to  maintain  progress  in  the  general  education  setting.  In other  words,  these  students  had  to  continuously  prove  they  “belonged.” As problematic as this was for students with mild disabilities, it proved to be even more discouraging for students with significant disabilities. This  “prove  you  belong ”  mindset  persists.  During  one  IEP meeting Julie  attended,  a  therapist  said,  “ When  Justine  develops  some  of  her daily  living  skills—like  toothbrushing  and  feeding  herself—she  might  be able  to  spend  some  time  in  general  education.”  In  this  therapist’s  mind, membership in the 4th grade class was dependent on personal care. Doug attended an IEP meeting during which a special educator said, “Once Brad has  mastered  100  sight  words,  he  can  probably  go  to  the  regular  class.” Does mastery of any number of sight words predict success in the general education classroom? And what better place for Brad to learn sight words than  alongside  his  peers,  who  already  know  them?  Reading  instruction does not stop or start at sight words, and the instruction necessary for all aspects  of  reading  can  be  provided  in  the  general  education  classroom. Students  with  disabilities  in  general  education  classrooms  deserve  the supports and services their IEP teams have designed. In addition, general and  special  educators  deserve  to  teach  in  environments  engineered  so that students can perform at high levels.


In  many  schools,  the  default  for  students  with  disabilities  is  still  to either put them into the lowest track in general education or assign them to  a  segregated  special  education  classroom.  Although  this  could  technically  provide  access  to  grade-level  curriculum,  too  often  the  special education  class  is  taught  by  someone  who  does  not  have  deep  content knowledge,  and  thus,  expectations  are  lowered.  We  visited  a  high  school in which the special education teacher was expected to teach three different history classes (World History, U.S. History, and Government) in the same period to different students. And the special education teacher had neither a history degree nor credentials in that area.


The long-term outcomes for this practice are dismal. The gaps in learning  that  persist  are  evidence  that  teaching  students  below-grade-level content is not working. The model of “pull out and replace the curriculum” isn’t effective for students who need support. The approach that works is an inclusive one in which students receive the general education instruction and supplemental instruction (Fuchs et al., 2006; Torgesen, 2002).




A Culture of Intervention for All


The  inception  of  special  education  legislation  in  1975  established,  via funding  mechanisms,  the  practice  of  sorting  students  into  two  groups: those who have a defined disability and those who do not. Ever since, the “disability”  label  has  determined  whether  students  qualify  for  an  IEP, special  education  services,  and  the  legal  protections  of  the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 2006).


For  example,  a  student  could  receive  an  intellectual  disability  diagnosis by scoring at least two standard deviations below the mean on a standardised test of intellectual functioning. A student with an IQ score of 70 or  below  would  be  eligible  for  intellectual  disability  diagnosis  and  thus qualify for and receive special education services and support. A student with an IQ score of 72 would not be eligible for the diagnosis, the services, or the support. There is no grey area in this model; students are “in” and get support, or they are “out” and don’t. Of course, narrowly missing the test range doesn’t mean that a student’s academic  struggles  will  suddenly  disappear.  What  about  the  student who “narrowly  misses”  the  definition of autism? Or learning  disability? Or  any other disability? The truth is that the students we serve are on a continuum, and while some will formally qualify for special education supports and services, others will not—and yet, these students still have needs to be met. While  this  overly  simplified sorting strategy may meet the technical definition  of  providing  students  with  disabilities  access  to  the  general curriculum, it has little to do with addressing the core question: What do students actually need to be successful in the general curriculum? Some students who need intensive support do not meet the criteria for a disability label. And many students who have a disability label do not need intensive support.  The  definitions are simply a way to identify some students and provide them with, as Snow (2005) says, “a sociopolitical passport to services” (p.2).


It’s  essential  to  remember  that  a  student’s  disability  status  is  not  the same as a student’s needs, and the two should not be confused. Disability status is  a  means  for  schools  to  assign  fiscal  and  personnel  assets.  A  student’s need  for  support may not result in a formal designation or paperwork such as an IEP, but those needs are also met through fiscal assets in the form of personnel, curriculum, and technology. Think of it this way: a student who needs intensive intervention to learn to read fluently should be  provided  that  intensive  intervention.  It  doesn’t  matter  if  the  student isn’t reading fluently because of a learning disability, because English is a second language, because past years’ reading instruction was dreadful, or because of frequent absences. It doesn’t matter if no reason is ever identified at all. The student has a need, and it’s the school’s responsibility to provide  the  support  to  address  it.  


Disability  labels  are  largely  irrelevant to  everyday  teaching  because  they  tell  us  so  little  about  what  individual students need; there isn’t “autism maths” or “physical disability reading.” By removing a focus on labels, we can concentrate on the important work of  planning  and  providing  meaningful  instruction  for  each  student.  Students  who  have   disabilities  do  not  have  “special  needs”;  they  only  have special rights. And any student who has a need, with or without a disability, may benefit from the expertise of a specialist, the form of personnel, curriculum, and technology. Think of it this way: a student who needs intensive intervention to learn to read fluently should be  provided  that  intensive  intervention.  It  doesn’t  matter  if  the  student isn’t reading fluently because of a learning disability, because English is a second language, because past years’ reading instruction was dreadful, or because of frequent absences. It doesn’t matter if no reason is ever identified at all. The student has a need, and it’s the school’s responsibility to provide  the  support  to  address  it.

Stu- dents  who  have  disabilities  do  not  have  “special  needs”;  they  only  have special rights. And any student who has a need, with or without a disability, may benefit from the expertise of a specialist.


Accommodations and Modifications for Every Student


Disability  status  doesn’t  inform  instruction;  it  should  not  be  the  sole criterion  when  making  decisions  about  providing  accommodations  and modifications.  If  students  need  support  to succeed,  it  should  not  matter whether  they  have  been  identified as having a disability. If a child needs help, why would we not provide it?
Issues of fairness are often raised in response to this question. Maybe you’ve heard, “It’s not fair to give a student extra time on this test unless they  have  a  documented  disability.”  But  think  about  where  the  lack  of fairness really lies.  


Taking  a  close  look  at  what  accommodations  and modifications  actually  accomplish,  it  becomes  clear  that  these  are  simply  necessary  strategies  to  help  students  learn.  In  other  words,  they  are part of the equity efforts schools use to ensure that all students ultimately succeed. Just as the expertise of specialists can benefit all students, truly inclusive  environments  ensure  that  accommodations  and  modifications are available for any student who needs them.


Accommodations
Accommodations are changes to the curriculum or assessments that provide access to the general curriculum but do not fundamentally alter the learning goal or grade-level standard. These supports “level the playing field” (Freedman, 2005, p. 47). Put another way, accommodations are support for a skill that is different from the skill being taught and assessed (Jung, 2018a). Take, for example, a student learning to drive. The  skill  being  taught  and  measured  is  driving.  If  the  student  is  near- sighted and needs glasses during driving instruction and during the driv- er’s exam in order to read street signs and see other vehicles more clearly, wearing glasses is an accommodation. It makes mastering the skill of driving  easier,  but  it  doesn’t  make  it  easier  than  it  would  be  for  anyone  else; the  accommodation  simply  levels  the  playing  field. And it does not matter if a person who wears glasses does not fit into a disability category; the accommodation is provided any time it is needed. In fact, if a person needs glasses,  driving  skills  cannot  be  measured  with  validity  if  the  glasses  are not allowed. Putting fairness aside, this is a basic measurement issue. The same applies to academic content. 


Consider a social studies class where  the  purpose  of  a  lesson  is  to  teach  students  to  evaluate  the  credibility of sources. At present, Akemi, a student who is an English learner, is much better at expressing what she knows verbally than in writing. So the  social  studies  teacher,  Ms.  Kintzler,  allows  Akemi  to  complete  the lesson  task  orally  instead  of  in  writing.  The  teacher  sits  with  Akemi  and asks  her  to  describe  how  she  evaluated  the  sources  of  evidence  for  credibility.  Ms.  Kintzler  asks  follow-up  questions,  as  do  two  other  students who are included in the conversation because Ms. Kintzler believes expo- sure to Akemi’s explanation will help them strengthen their own written responses. The content of Akemi’s responses is evaluated as any other student’s response is evaluated, against the same requirements or standards. It’s an accommodation made to allow for valid measurement. 


There   are   likely   several   students   in   any   class   that   would   benefit from  these  types  of  supports.  One  key  to  meeting  the  various  needs  in  a classroom  is  to  mobilise  peers.  Collaborative  learning  allows  students to  engage  in  meaningful  tasks  while  the  teacher  meets  with  individuals or  small  groups.  In  addition,  peers  can  provide  support  to  members  of their class.


In Ms. Kintzler’s social studies class, some students with test anxiety need additional time or a separate setting when undergoing assessments. The teacher also reads questions or prompts for one student who has significant difficulty with reading. These basic adaptations are accommodations because they support skills that are different from the social studies standards  being  taught  and  measured.  And,  just  like  wearing  glasses while  driving,  it  doesn’t  matter  whether  a  student  fits into a disability category;  the  accommodation  should  be  provided  any  time  it  is  needed.


Accommodations do not make the content easier; they permit access to it. Again, this is a measurement issue: without providing these students these  accommodations,  Ms.  Kintzler  would  be  unable  to  measure  the students’ skills in social studies because the expression of those skills is affected by an outside influence (e.g., test anxiety, reading difficulty, writing difficulty). Disability status is irrelevant here; all Ms.  Kintzler needs to  know  when  designing  and  implementing  accommodations  is  that there  is  an  issue,  separate  from  an  understanding  of  the  social  studies content,  that  prevents  her  students  from  being  able  to  show  what  they know or are able to do.


Modifications

Modifications function differently from accommodations; they are changes to the curriculum and assessments that do fundamentally  alter  the  learning  goal  or  grade-level  expectation. Unlike accommodations,  which  simply  level  the  playing  field,  modifications “change  the  game”  (Freedman,  2005,  p.  48)  and  support  the  skill  that is  being  taught  and  measured (Jung,  2017b).  Returning  to  the  vision example, if a person wears glasses or contact lenses during an eye exam, this  changes  what  is  being  measured.  In  reporting  the  results  of  any assessment  with  modifications,  it  is  important  to  record  the  modification provided, because something different was being measured. In this example, the optician might be measuring the effectiveness of the contact lens prescription.


Suppose  students  in  a  class  are  working  on  algebra  problems  that require  multiplication  of  fractions.  Erik  needs  support.  He  is  working below grade level in maths and is learning multiplication with whole numbers. Erik’s practice work and assessments do not include the grade-level algebraic  problems  that  require  multiplication  of  fractions.  Instead,  he is  practising  with  whole-number  multiplication  problems  and  one-step algebra  problems  requiring  addition  and  subtraction.  This  is  a  comparably  rigorous  skill  for  this  student;  the  adapted  skill  is  just  as  difficult for  this  student  as  the  grade-level  skill  is  for  students  who  do  not  need support. What is being taught and measured has been changed, however, and the maths skill being assessed is the skill that is being supported. It is important to clearly record when a student’s progress is based on modified  expectations.  Making  modifications  to  assignments  or  other tasks and reporting the student’s performance without acknowledging the modification  sends  the  message  that  the student  is  performing  at  grade level. Teachers should always aim for accurate communication regarding how students are performing. It  is  also  essential  to  note  that  modifications  should  be  provided  any time they are needed, but not unnecessarily. As we like to say, only as “special” as necessary. 


Modifications change what is expected of the student, in effect saying, “This student is not currently on track to master the grade level expectation. We are putting into place a comparably rigorous modified  expectation.”  This  is  serious  business,  and  modifications  should  be used only when absolutely necessary—and this should be a team decision, supported  by  data  on  the  student’s  performance  in  the  context  of  high-quality  instruction  and  intervention.  Teachers  also  need  to  be  on  guard against providing “accidental modifications” through well-meaning sup- port. A teacher might not go so far as to formally modify expectations for a student, but sometimes cueing and scaffolding and prompting and hinting result in providing an accidental modification.


The Power of Expectations


The  voicing  of  low  expectations  for  students  with  disabilities  and  their families often starts very early in their lives. Lee Ann’s friend Susan has a daughter named Irene who was born with a rare genetic condition called chromosome 5p deletion syndrome. The medical team told Susan and her husband that Irene would never walk, talk, or be able to go to school. 


A kid named Alfredo shared in a transition planning meeting that after he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, his mother was told by members of his special education team that he would “never be successful in life” and that he would never do well in school. They told her that he would never graduate from high school or be able to hold a job. His mother was devastated, and who wouldn’t be? With any diagnosis, it’s impossible to know exactly what the future will hold.  Today,  Irene  is  a  healthy,  happy,  spunky  teenager  who  walks,  talks, runs,  reads,  writes,  jokes,  laughs,  lives  a  full  life,  and  spends  her  time  at school  in  the  general  education  classroom.  Alfredo  went  on  to  graduate from high school with a 3.8 grade point average, and he has completed his first year at a four-year university as a criminal justice major. Some might say  Irene  is  a  miracle.  Perhaps  it  is  a  medical  marvel  that  she  is  healthy and has the physical abilities that she does, but it is no miracle that she is achieving her potential. Her entire family has worked very hard to make sure  Irene’s  dreams  were  realised.  Similarly,  Alfredo’s  mother  decided that  she  wouldn’t  let  her  son’s  disability  define  him;  she  focused  on  possibilities  and  ensured  that  others  on  Alfredo’s  educational  team  did  the same. This is what happens when we have high expectations and put supports in place to ensure students have every chance to reach them.


Too often, students and  their families run into the wall of low and limited  expectations.  Educators should  be  very  careful  about  predicting the future. We have no idea what the future holds, what innovations and inventions  will  come,  and  how  students  will  respond  to  great  learning experiences.  The  least  dangerous  assumption  we  can  make  is  that  stu- dents will learn and that they will have amazing lives. The most dangerous assumption we can make is that students will fail. Imagine the difference when our assumptions come true. 


When professionals focus on what can’t happen, they are also putting limitations  on  a  student’s  ability  to  dream.  The  professionals  in  these stories surely didn’t intend to crush children’s and parents’ dreams. Educators don’t go into the field because they want to squash children’s aspirations. But in far too many instances, well-meaning physicians, therapists, counsellors,  psychologists,  and  educators  enter  the  conversation  about  a student’s future with their own ideas and expectations of how this future should look. Who are we to decide what is or isn’t possible for a student? No  disability—whether  a  specific  learning  disability,  physical  disability, intellectual  disability,  or  any  diagnosis—should  limit  the  future  for  any individual to have a life of fulfilment, one in which they feel they belong and contribute and receive joy in their everyday lives. This is what every human being deserves. It  is  the  responsibility  of  adult  mentors  to  guide  young  people  along the  path  to  success  however those  young  people define  success.  Attending to the aspirations of students and their families is an issue of cultural competence.  In  this  way,  educators  take  on  the  role  of  dream  manager: paving a path and allowing students to meet their goals. The dream manager validates and supports the dream, no matter how lofty it may seem, identifying and removing obstacles to help make it happen. Haven’t we all set what seemed to be unrealistic goals for ourselves? Even when we don’t actually  reach  the  goal,  more  often  than  not,  the  setting  of  the  goal  and striving to meet these goals causes us to push harder and go for something big. And how often have you surprised yourself in what you can achieve? 


Hattie’s meta-analyses of numerous educational studies (2012) revealed that students’  expectations  of  their  own  success  are  among  the greatest predictors of their outcomes, with an effect size of 1.44. Limiting students’ ability to dream limits their actual outcomes. Our job as educators is to support the student’s vision, hope, and dreams, and never get in the way or diminish the possibilities. Throughout  the  IEP  process,  educators  are  wise  to  take  advantage  of families’  knowledge  and  treat  them  as  a  full  partner  at  the  table.  Fami- lies are the constant in children’s lives and know their children best. This expertise is often overlooked and not used as a cornerstone for developing  IEPs  and  transition  plans.  


Over  the  course  of  their  elementary  and secondary years, children spend a lot of time in school.  How are teachers connecting  with  families  in  identifying  children’s  aspirations  and  aligning curriculum and activities to the goals and dreams of each child? When communication with families is strong, educators and parents can share the role of dream manager. 


Conclusion

The  drive  for  truly  inclusive  education  is  a  critical  part  of  the  broader effort  aimed  at achieving  equity  in  education.  It  means  reimagining  systems to expand every student’s access to both the general education curriculum and intervention supports and services. It also means building a culture in which this expansion is the expectation and the norm, in which everyone agrees that there is no such thing as “good teaching ” that leaves some students unserved and unsupported. Creating  this  new  and  better  model  of  education  begins  with  taking action  to  adjust  the  language  used  in  schools,  the  services  provided,  and the expectations set for students with disabilities and those at risk. Doing so  establishes  a  climate  in  which  students  can  achieve  outcomes  that might once have been considered unrealistic.
